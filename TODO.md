# Todo

* Clean up tmuxp config files and add completion (Currently it uses bash completion in the command, which we don't really want)
* Add command to dump variable
* Add command to get escaped text (like cat -A. but can we improve it?)
* Fix delay in pasting  (Coming from autosuggestions plugin)
* Look into zplugin as a replacement for what we are using zgen for
* Script to set up patched font e.g. curl -fLo "~/Library/Font/Meslo LG M Regular for Powerline Nerd Font Complete.otf" "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/master/patched-fonts/Meslo/M/complete/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.otf"$$$$$$
