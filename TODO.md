# Todo

* Clean up tmuxp config files and add completion (Currently it uses bash completion in the command, which we don't really want)
* Add command to dump variable
* Add command to get escaped text (like cat -A. but can we improve it?)
* Check if we can clean up key bindings
* Add back syntax highlighting
* Fix delay in pasting  (Coming from autosuggestions plugin)
* Look into zplugin as a replacement for what we are using zgen for
